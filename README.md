# Dungeon Expedition

It will be a text-based console RPG that will take us into dark and dangerous dungeons.

Main elements of the game

- Chapters and progression: The game will be divided into chapters, and each chapter will offer a save game state.
- Dungeons and bosses: The main objective will be to conquer dungeons and defeat the bosses guarding each floor, and along the way we will face smaller monsters, gaining experience and loot.
- Treasures and equipment: In the dungeons, you will be able to open treasure chests, acquire a variety of items, and then sell them at the trader to buy better equipment.
- Adventurer's Guild: We will be able to join an adventurer's guild to perform various tasks and gain higher ranks.
- Bilingualism: The game will support two languages, English and Polish.

1. Why a console?
- because I want to focus first on learning the language and that is my main goal, but if I like this project I don't see any obstacles to move it to the 2D or 3D world the more so because I was interested in the Bevy engine.
2. How often will there be updates?
- I plan to undertake the development of individual functionalities after gaining specific knowledge and doing some tasks such as Rustlings, or smaller projects so they will not be introduced quickly and often but I feel that they will be crucial for the project.
3. Why bilingualism?
- I found it an interesting challenge to work with files where I would like to store translations and dialogues.
